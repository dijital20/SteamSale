SteamSale
=========

This is a simple script I wrote to scrape the current deals from the Steam Summer Sale (Summer 2014) and return a formatted list to the console.

The code is not, by far, perfect. I wrote this primarily to learn BeautifulSoup and the art of web scraping. This could be refit at the next Steam Sale to monitor deals.
